Hello!

I am a Molecular Biology student at Simon Fraser University, currently working with some friends as part of a small minecraft modding team called Rasa Novum.

Our goal is to make mods that are simple and useful for members of the community; things we would want to use ourselves.

Currently we have a Timber Frames building block mod, as well as a Food Extensions mod in the works.

I primarily know Python, as it's what I learned most formally, but I've been having fun exploring java and learning as I go. I plan on learning C++ and C# as well, and I may have to learn R for school on top of that.

I use VSCode for most of my Python work, and IntelliJ for my Java work.
