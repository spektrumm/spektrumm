Hello!

I am a Molecular Biology student at Simon Fraser University, currently working with some friends as part of a small minecraft modding team called Rasa Novum.

Our goal is to make mods that are simple and useful for members of the community; things we would want to use ourselves.

We are currently in the development stage of curating a 1.18 modpack, featuring some of our own mods alongside other popular selections.

I primarily know Python, as it's what I learned most formally, but I've been having fun exploring Java and learning as I go. C# and JS have been lots of fun to teach myself. C# definitely put me outside my comfort zone, while JS was a little bit easier to take on as it is similar to Python. Ideally I'd like to learn C++ or Rust at some point in the future but it isn't a main concern of mine for now.

I use VSCode for my Python, C# and JS work, and IntelliJ for my Java work. I do a majority of my coding on a 14 inch M1 Pro Macbook Pro, however I also have a desktop gaming PC that I will occasionally be productive on as well.
