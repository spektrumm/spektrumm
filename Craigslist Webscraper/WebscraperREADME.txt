This was a project that I undertook following along youtuber/streamer Michael Reeves as he coded 
almost this exact bot on his livestream over at "twitch.tv".

I thought this was a cool thing to have so I adapted it for my local craigslist market and my own interests.
At the time of creation, GPU prices were just starting to rise (little did I know that they would only keep going up due to
silicon shortage). This gave me a nice use for this webscraper, as it would show me any good deals that would pop up,
give me the link to them, so I could then send them to my friends who were looking to get into PC gaming or looking to upgrade their rigs.

Michael actually does a lot in Lua on stream for the OTV minecraft server that he plays on, and his streams are very informative.
He streamed some work on getting a drill to be remotely operated by twitch chat which was quite the cool feature, and I hope to see more
projects from him in the future as he is a great source of inspiration and motivation, as well as better teacher than he lets on.
